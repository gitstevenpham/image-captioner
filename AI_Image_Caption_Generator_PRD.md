# 🧠 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Product: AI-Powered Image Caption Generator  
**Author:** ChatGPT
**Date:** October 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Overview

### 🧩 Summary  
The **AI-Powered Image Caption Generator** allows users to upload an image and receive an intelligent, descriptive caption generated by an AI model (e.g., BLIP, CLIP, or Gemini Vision API). Users can optionally **rate** the quality of the caption, and over time, the system will adapt to their preferred tone or style (e.g., poetic, factual, witty).

### 🎯 Goal  
Create a simple but powerful web app that:
- Generates high-quality, human-like captions from images  
- Provides a clean UX for image uploads and caption display  
- Learns from user feedback to improve personalized caption generation  

### 🧑‍💻 Use Case  
- Content creators seeking inspiration for Instagram or photography captions  
- Developers learning about vision-language models  
- Casual users exploring AI creativity

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

### ✅ Objectives
1. Enable users to generate captions for uploaded images within 5 seconds.  
2. Provide a user-friendly rating and feedback interface.  
3. Build a foundation for adaptive personalization (style tuning).

### 📊 Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|---------|
| Average caption generation time | < 5s |
| User satisfaction (avg rating) | ≥ 4.0 / 5 |
| Returning user rate | ≥ 25% |
| Captions rated by users | ≥ 60% of total captions |

## 3. Product Features

### 🖼️ Core Features
| Feature | Description | Priority |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Image Upload** | Users can drag & drop or select an image (JPEG, PNG). | P0 |
| **Caption Generation** | Backend generates caption via pre-trained model (BLIP-2, CLIP, or Gemini Vision API). | P0 |
| **Result Display** | Caption displayed below image with smooth fade-in animation. | P0 |
| **Caption Rating** | User rates caption (1–5 stars) to provide feedback. | P1 |
| **Style Adaptation** | System fine-tunes or re-ranks outputs based on rating patterns (e.g., prefers witty tone). | P2 |
| **Caption History** | Users can view their past captions and ratings. | P2 |

## 4. Technical Design

### ⚙️ System Architecture
**Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Flask  
**Model Integration:**  
- **Primary:** Hugging Face pre-trained model (e.g., `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`)  
- **Alternative:** Google Gemini API for multimodal inference  
**Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL (store captions, images, user feedback)  
**Storage:** AWS S3 or local `/uploads` for image storage  
**Retraining:** Light fine-tuning using LoRA or re-ranking model via feedback  

### 🧱 Data Flow
1. User uploads image (→ `/upload`)  
2. Backend stores file → sends to captioning model  
3. Model generates caption → returns JSON `{caption: "..."}`
4. Frontend displays caption  
5. User rates caption → backend stores `{image_id, caption, rating}`  
6. (Bonus) Periodic retraining or style adjustment

| ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.0) [Submit Rating]                         |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

### ✨ UX Notes
- Clean, minimal layout using Tailwind (neutral tones, focus on image)  
- Use Skeleton loaders while caption is being generated  
- Include tooltip for “Model generating caption...”

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Caption generation ≤ 5 seconds |
| **Scalability** | Model API can scale to multiple concurrent users |
| **Reliability** | Fallback captions if model fails |
| **Security** | Validate and sanitize uploaded images |
| **Maintainability** | Modular architecture for swapping models (e.g., Gemini → BLIP → LLaVA) |

---

## 7. Learning Goals (Developer Perspective)

- Learn computer vision basics (feature extraction, embeddings, inference).  
- Integrate pre-trained models using Hugging Face API or Gemini SDK.  
- Implement feedback loops for personalized model fine-tuning.  
- Full-stack deployment with Python backend and React frontend.
